# Flying Fruit üçâüçç

Flying Fruit is a creative playground for exploring scroll animations with React Three Fiber and Drei while working with 3D models optimized for the web. This project was inspired by Paul Henschel's [Flying Bananas tutorial](https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/2ycs3?file=%2Fpackage.json). It‚Äôs a great starting point for learning about 3D scroll animations, interactive scenes, and best practices for working with models in web projects.

## Features

- **Scroll animations**: Learning how to animate objects in a 3D scene based on user scroll input.
- **Optimized 3D models**: Using Sketchfab assets for high-quality visuals while keeping performance in mind.
- **Environment map**: An AI-generated skybox to enhance the realism of the scene.
- **Beginner-friendly setup**: Simple and approachable for anyone new to React Three Fiber or Drei.

## Environment Map üåå

The environment map was generated using [Skybox Labs](https://skybox.blockadelabs.com/). Large HDR files were converted to cube maps using [Matheowis' HDR to Cube Map Converter](https://matheowis.github.io/HDRI-to-CubeMap/) to ensure optimal performance. The SVG was created using (Canva)[https://www.canva.com/].

2. Install dependencies with `npm install`.
3. Start the development server with `npm start`.

## Inspiration

This project is inspired by the [Flying Bananas tutorial](https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/2ycs3?file=%2Fpackage.json) by Paul Henschel. And was based on the classic scroll animation by [Poimandres recreating Three.js Journey's techniques in R3F](https://journey.pmnd.rs/classic-techniques/scroll-based-animation).
